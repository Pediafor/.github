## 🚀 Philosophy  

Education is the only sector that has not evolved at the pace of technology.  
While most EdTech companies focus on **courses, content, and personalization**,  
**Pediafor focuses on the *infrastructure layer* for education** — scalable, open, and accessible to all.  

- 🔓 **Open by Default** — Open-source research & technology to drive collaboration.  
- ⚡ **AI-Centric** — Designing systems with responsible AI at the core.  
- 🌐 **Democratizing Access** — Empowering small & mid-sized institutions.  
- 🤝 **Community First** — Building education’s future together.  

---

## 🎯 Mission  

To **build the complete infrastructure stack for modern education**:  

✅ Secure & scalable SaaS tools for institutions  
✅ AI-driven assessment, grading, and analytics  
✅ Collaborative course authoring & knowledge sharing  
✅ Open-source components for easy integration  
✅ Commercial services & enterprise-grade support
